# Minecraft Image Bot
This is a Discord bot I created with JavaScript and NodeJS. This is a passion project of mine that I have been working on for many years. This has involved many changes and innovations to the code to try and clean up the "spaghetti code" that I used to code in. This Discord bot works by converting the submitted photo to one completely made out of Minecraft blocks.
